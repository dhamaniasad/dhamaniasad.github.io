title: Meteor.js - 2 Years On

Back in 2014, when JavaScript was just starting to gain foothold in the server market space, I stumbled upon this magical framework called Meteor(.js/JS?). 

It promised to make web development incredibly simple, through a marriage of frontend and backend. There would be rainbows and unicorns and magic. Lots of magic. An inexperienced developer could simply pick up the framework over a few days and start building apps over weeks instead of months. 

Or, at least, *that was the promise*. The problem is, with this incredible amount of magic also comes a lot of uncertainty. I've found Python to be incredibly good as a first language for developers because of this very reason. **You know where stuff is coming from.**
